# Creating an Issue

CATMAID encourages users to create GitHub issues to report any bugs or new
features ideas. If seeking assistance about configuring or using CATMAID, the
[CATMAID mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/catmaid) is the
best place to ask since your message will be seen by many CATMAID users and not
just core contributors.

When creating an issue for a bug, please include the following information if
relevant:

- CATMAID version (find this either by hovering your cursor over the "CATMAID"
  header on your CATMAID homepage or by running `git describe` in your CATMAID
  installation)
- If an error popup is shown, the text shown by pressing "show/hide detail" in
  the popup
- Any errors that occur in the javascript console. In Chrome, this console can
  be opened by pressing <kbd>CONTROL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>
  (<kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> in OS X), or by going
  through the menu to Tools > Javascript Console.
