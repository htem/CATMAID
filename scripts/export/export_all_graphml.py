# This file is meant to be run from within ./manage.py shell in the environment, like:
# [1] load export_all_graphml.py
# [2] project_id = 12
# [2] export(project_id, "all.graphml")
#
# Will generate a gzip'ed file like "all.graphml.gz"
#
# Includes all skeletons with more than 1 treenode;
# each skeleton is an undirected graph, where each treenode is a node
# (with the skeleton ID and the location as extra attributes)
# and each relationship between child and parent treenodes is an undirected edge
# that has the skeleton ID as an extra attribute.
# Each presynaptic+postsynaptic connection is a directed edge between treenodes;
# these directed edges also contain the skeleton ID of the pre- and the postsynaptic
# skeletons.
